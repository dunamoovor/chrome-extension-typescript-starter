Po is a clumsy and overweight panda who works at his father's noodle shop. He loves kung fu and idolizes the Furious Five, a group of elite warriors trained by Master Shifu. One day, he learns that the legendary Dragon Warrior will be chosen from among the kung fu masters at the Jade Palace. He rushes to the palace, hoping to catch a glimpse of his heroes, but accidentally crashes into the ceremony and is selected as the Dragon Warrior by Master Oogway, an elderly tortoise and Shifu's mentor.
 
Shifu and the Furious Five are shocked and dismayed by Po's selection, believing that he is not worthy of the title. Shifu tries to discourage Po from training by making him endure harsh exercises and humiliating tasks. Meanwhile, Tai Lung, a former student of Shifu who turned evil and was imprisoned for trying to steal the Dragon Scroll, a mysterious artifact that grants limitless power to the Dragon Warrior, escapes from his prison with the help of a feathered messenger named Zeng. Shifu sends Zeng to warn Oogway's friend Master Rhino of Tai Lung's escape, but Zeng unwittingly helps Tai Lung by dropping a feather that unlocks his chains.
 
Oogway tells Shifu that he must believe in Po and train him as the Dragon Warrior. He then passes away peacefully, leaving behind his staff. Shifu reluctantly agrees to train Po, but finds him unmotivated and depressed. He takes him to a sacred peach tree where Oogway used to meditate and tells him the story of how Tai Lung became corrupted by his pride and ambition. He also reveals that he was the one who raised Tai Lung as his son and taught him kung fu, but failed to see his darkness until it was too late. He blames himself for Tai Lung's fall and fears that he will make the same mistake with Po.
 
Po confides in Shifu that he has no idea why he was chosen as the Dragon Warrior and that he feels like he doesn't belong anywhere. Shifu sympathizes with Po and decides to use his love for food as a way to motivate him. He teaches him kung fu through various food-related exercises, such as catching dumplings with chopsticks and balancing on soup bowls. Po gradually improves his skills and confidence, impressing both Shifu and the Furious Five.
 
One day, Shifu receives news that Tai Lung is approaching the valley. He decides that it is time for Po to receive the Dragon Scroll and become the Dragon Warrior. However, when Po opens the scroll, he finds it blank. Shifu believes that this is a sign that Oogway was wrong about Po and orders him to leave. Po returns to his father's noodle shop, where his father reveals a secret ingredient for his famous noodle soup: nothing. He explains that it is not the ingredient that makes something special, but rather one's belief in it.
 
Po realizes that this is the meaning of the Dragon Scroll: there is no secret to being the Dragon Warrior, but rather one must believe in oneself. He returns to the palace with renewed determination, only to find it under attack by Tai Lung and his army of wolves. He joins forces with the Furious Five and fights Tai Lung on a rope bridge. Using his agility and creativity, Po manages to hold off Tai Lung until Shifu arrives.
 
Shifu tells Po and the Furious Five to evacuate the valley while he faces Tai Lung alone. He confronts his former student in a fierce battle, but is overpowered by Tai Lung's nerve strike technique. Tai Lung demands the Dragon Scroll from Shifu, but is surprised when Shifu tells him that he doesn't have it. He then sees Po holding the scroll and chases after him.
 
Po reaches the village where he grew up and faces Tai Lung in a final showdown. Tai Lung tries to use his nerve strike on Po, but it has no effect on him due to his fat body. Po uses his own style of kung fu, which incorporates his size and personality, to counter Tai Lung's attacks. He also uses various objects from his surroundings as weapons, such as fireworks, a wok lid, and a radish.
 
Po eventually gains the upper hand and pins Tai Lung down with his belly. He then performs a powerful move called the Wuxi Finger Hold, which causes a massive explosion
